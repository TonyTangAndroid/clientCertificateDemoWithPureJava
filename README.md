This project is only used to demonstrate the following purpose:

1, how to send HTTPS request with client certificate with OkHttp.
2, SSLSocketFactory could be reused for multiple request, which contradicts the case if the code runs on Android System.

Please refer to this repository for sample running on Android system.
